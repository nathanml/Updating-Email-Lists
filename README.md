# Updating-Email-Lists

As Webmaster of my fraternity APO, one of my key responsibilities is updating
email lists. This required logging into each eboard member's email account and
moving each brother that needs to be moved to the proper group. I wrote this
program instead which takes in a name and a new group. It defines the Brother class
and emailList class.

Ultimately, the function changeList, which takes in a Brother object and an emailList object, allows me to change the list of the inputted brother to the desired list.
